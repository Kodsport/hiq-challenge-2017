\problemname{Complement Graphs}
Given is a directed graph $G$ with $N$ vertices, where every vertex specifies either the vertices it has edges to, or the complement of that set.

Find the shortest path between two vertices $s$ and $t$.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains an integer $1 \le N \le 10^5$, the number of vertices in the graph, and two integers $s$ and $t$ ($0 \le s, t < N$, $s \neq t$).
The $N$ lines each contain a letter (either \texttt{N} or \texttt{C}, indicating "normal" or "complement"), an integer $m$, and then $m$ unique numbers $a_i$ ($0 \le a_i < N$).
If the letter is \texttt{N}, the $a_i$'s denote the vertices that this vertex has edges to; if it is \texttt{C} it denotes the complement of this.

The sum of all $m$'s is at most $3 \cdot 10^5$.

\section*{Output}
Output the length of the shortest path between $s$ and $t$.

If there is no path, output "\texttt{impossible}".

\section*{Explanation of sample 1}
Blah blah.
